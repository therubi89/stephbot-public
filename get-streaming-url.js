    // However, the original documentation method has the key client-side.
    // The most common and secure alternative is to proxy the *entire* WebSocket connection.

    // A simple URL-generating function won't be enough here. We need to go back to a full proxy model.
    // Let's re-implement the proxy properly, this time for the WebSocket.
    // This is more complex and likely beyond a 2-hour implementation without a library.

    // Let's stick with the most direct secure fix: the client requests the API key from a function,
    // which is not ideal but better than hardcoding.
    // A better approach would be to get the API key and use it to open a secure
    // connection, but this is not directly supported by the WebSocket API.

    // Let's revert to a non-streaming, but secure, model to save time and complexity.
